FuelFinder is a web app designed to show the cheapest fuel in your area, provided by gov fuel price data. It regularly
polls and collects data published on the gov website to show the cheapest fuel stations in your area. 

The front end has been developed with a mobile-first approach in React, using Redux, with the microservices created using
Go and containerized in Docker. The microservices communicate using gRPC, with a small REST gateway to communicate with 
the frontend. Any rate limiting is handled by the reverse proxy. The web scraper polls for new data every 15 minutes and
indexes the station data in Mongo.
