During my placement year, I worked as a Junior Software Developer for Pear Technology; an Ordnance Survey partner
which specialised in providing a range of geospatial solutions, services and software to clients such as land agents and councils. 

I was responsible for the company's online map shop with any new features that needed development or bugs that needed
fixing. I also assisted in the development of PearGIS, a greenfield project utilizng a powerful new map engine in WPF.
