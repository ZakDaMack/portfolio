Initially started out as a freelancer before becoming a full-time Senior Software Engineer at 1FIT; a tech startup
in the fitness industry looking to modernise how coaches interact with and keep track of their clientelle.

During my freelance period, I was involved in all aspects of the devlopment life cycle, including the development
and design of the API server and databases, using a mix of both SQL and NoSQL databases. I then went on to assist
the consultant to design and build the infrastructure, utilizing Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) to
ensure high availability and scalability. 

I have also worked on a client app using Flutter to create a native mobile app for both Android and iOS as well as
using Mobile Development tools such as Codemagic to help automate deployment to the App Stores.
