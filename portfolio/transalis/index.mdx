After graduation from the University of Portsmouth, I worked at Transalis; who are a leading supply chain 
automation provider, supporting businesses of all sizes with EDI, eInvoice, and system integration solutions.

During projects, I would work closely with clients in order to understand their requirements and build their
integration with with third parties. Larger integration projects would sometimes require leading small groups
and assign tasks based on suitability as well as informing clients and managers on the group's progress.

A personal project within the company was to develop a permissioned blockchain application in Java to store
transferred company data by consuming Kafka events. The application could then be accessed via REST API. I
also earned Certified Blockchain Security Professional (CBSP) certification with Blockchain Training Alliance
(BTA). During deployment of this application, I worked closely with the infrastructure team to help with server
setup, and server/app monitoring.
