Headed a 5 person development team as Development Team Lead for Blue Square Marketing; a retail marketing
company innovating customer engagement across the buyer to customer journey, working with brands such as
Samsung, HP and BTEE.

The initial project involved creating a 'darkstore', which is a virtual store which provides a platform
where customers can browse online and speak to an expert instantly in a live studio environment. The software 
project was a success and led to a quick expansion of the development team to persue a number of new projects 
within the company.

Later projects included Teamsquare, an employee engagement and experience platform, and Experts Your Way, a
platform for customers, engineers and CX teams to interact with each other and the various different third
party platforms into a single platform. These projects were written using Laravel and Vue and served using 
Amazon EC2 and Cloudfront.

With 4 developers working across a multitude of different projects, it became necessary to put time into
implementing agile methodologies and DevOps to improve productivity and reduce the possibility of bugs and
flaws making their way into the production builds.
